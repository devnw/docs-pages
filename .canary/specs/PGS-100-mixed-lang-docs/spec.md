# Feature Specification: Mixed-Language Documentation Processing

**Requirement ID:** PGS-100
**Aspect:** Docs
**Status:** STUB
**Created:** 2025-10-19
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-19

## Overview

**Purpose:** Enable the GitHub Action to properly process and render documentation for applications that contain both Go and Zig source code, ensuring that generated documentation pages correctly display API references, function signatures, and code examples from both languages.

**Scope:** This feature covers the detection, parsing, and rendering of documentation from mixed Go/Zig codebases, including proper syntax highlighting, cross-language linking, and unified navigation structure.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories

**US-1: Mixed-Language Documentation Discovery**
As a developer using this GitHub Action,
I want the system to automatically detect both Go and Zig source files in my repository,
So that documentation is generated for all relevant code regardless of language.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System scans repository and identifies .go and .zig files
- [ ] Both languages are included in documentation generation process
- [ ] No manual configuration required for language detection

**US-2: Unified Documentation Rendering**
As a developer viewing generated documentation,
I want to see API documentation from both Go and Zig code in a single, cohesive interface,
So that I can understand the complete API surface of my mixed-language application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Go documentation appears with proper Go syntax highlighting
- [ ] Zig documentation appears with proper Zig syntax highlighting
- [ ] Both languages are accessible through unified navigation
- [ ] Cross-language references are properly linked

**US-3: Language-Specific Documentation Features**
As a developer,
I want each language's documentation to maintain its native conventions and features,
So that the documentation feels natural and familiar for each language community.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Go documentation includes package-level documentation
- [ ] Go documentation shows exported functions, types, and constants
- [ ] Zig documentation includes comptime functions and compile-time features
- [ ] Zig documentation shows proper error handling patterns

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Multi-Language File Detection
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The system must automatically detect and categorize source files by language (Go and Zig) without requiring manual configuration.
**Acceptance:** Repository scan identifies all .go and .zig files and categorizes them correctly.

### FR-2: Go Documentation Processing
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The system must process Go source files and extract documentation comments, function signatures, type definitions, and package information.
**Acceptance:** All Go documentation comments are parsed and rendered with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.

### FR-3: Zig Documentation Processing
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The system must process Zig source files and extract documentation comments, function signatures, type definitions, and module information.
**Acceptance:** All Zig documentation comments are parsed and rendered with proper formatting and syntax highlighting.

### FR-4: Unified Navigation Structure
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** The system must create a single navigation structure that allows users to browse documentation from both languages seamlessly.
**Acceptance:** Users can navigate between Go and Zig documentation sections without losing context or requiring separate interfaces.

### FR-5: Cross-Language Reference Linking
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** The system must identify and properly link references between Go and Zig code where applicable.
**Acceptance:** When Go code calls Zig functions or vice versa, the documentation provides appropriate cross-references.

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- [ ] 100% of Go source files with documentation comments are processed and rendered
- [ ] 100% of Zig source files with documentation comments are processed and rendered
- [ ] Documentation generation completes in < 2 minutes for repositories with < 1000 source files
- [ ] Zero false positives in language detection (no .go files detected as Zig or vice versa)

**Qualitative Measures:**
- [ ] Generated documentation maintains native language conventions and formatting
- [ ] Users can easily distinguish between Go and Zig documentation sections
- [ ] Navigation feels intuitive and doesn't require language-specific knowledge
- [ ] Documentation accurately represents the actual API surface of both languages

**Important:** All success criteria must be:
- **Measurable**: Include specific numbers/percentages
- **Technology-Agnostic**: No mention of implementation details
- **User-Focused**: Describe outcomes from user perspective
- **Verifiable**: Can be tested without knowing implementation

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Mixed Repository
**Given:** A repository contains both Go and Zig source files with documentation comments
**When:** The GitHub Action runs documentation generation
**Then:** Both languages are detected, processed, and rendered in a unified documentation site

### Scenario 2: Edge Case - Single Language Repository
**Given:** A repository contains only Go or only Zig source files
**When:** The GitHub Action runs documentation generation
**Then:** The system processes the single language correctly without errors or missing functionality

### Scenario 3: Error Case - Malformed Documentation Comments
**Given:** A repository contains source files with malformed or incomplete documentation comments
**When:** The GitHub Action runs documentation generation
**Then:** The system gracefully handles malformed comments and continues processing other files

## Key Entities

### Entity 1: Source File
**Attributes:**
- language: Go or Zig
- path: file system path
- content: source code content
- documentation: extracted documentation comments

**Relationships:**
- belongs to a package/module
- may reference other source files

### Entity 2: Documentation Page
**Attributes:**
- title: page title
- language: source language
- content: rendered documentation
- navigation: links to other pages

**Relationships:**
- generated from source files
- linked to other documentation pages

## Assumptions

- Go and Zig source files follow standard documentation comment conventions
- Repository structure allows for clear separation of Go and Zig code
- Users expect documentation to maintain language-specific conventions
- Cross-language references are relatively rare but should be supported when they exist

## Constraints

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must work within GitHub Actions environment limitations
- Must support standard Go and Zig documentation comment formats
- Must generate output compatible with MkDocs Material theme

**Business Constraints:**
- Should not require significant changes to existing repository structures
- Must maintain backward compatibility with single-language repositories

**Regulatory Constraints:**
- None identified

## Out of Scope

- Support for other programming languages beyond Go and Zig
- Automatic translation of documentation between languages
- Real-time documentation updates (only batch processing)
- Custom documentation comment formats beyond standard conventions

## Dependencies

- Existing Go documentation processing capabilities (godocdown)
- MkDocs Material theme for rendering
- GitHub Actions environment for execution
- Standard Go and Zig toolchains for parsing

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Zig documentation parsing complexity | High | Medium | Research Zig documentation standards and create robust parser |
| Cross-language reference detection | Medium | High | Implement conservative approach with manual configuration option |
| Performance impact on large repositories | Medium | Medium | Implement incremental processing and caching |

## Clarifications Resolved

**Zig documentation comment format:** Use standard Zig documentation comments (/// format) for consistency with language conventions.

**Cross-language reference scope:** Implement conservative automatic detection with manual configuration override option for complex cases.

**Navigation structure preference:** Separate sections per language with unified index, providing clear language separation while maintaining cohesive navigation.
