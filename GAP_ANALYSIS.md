# Requirements Gap Analysis

## Claimed Requirements

List requirements that are fully implemented and verified:

✅ CBIN-001 - UserAuth API fully tested
✅ CBIN-002 - DataValidation with benchmarks

## Gaps

List requirements that are planned or in progress:

- [ ] CBIN-003 - ReportGeneration (STATUS=IMPL, needs tests)
- [ ] CBIN-004 - CacheOptimization (STATUS=STUB)

## Verification

Run verification with:

```bash
canary scan --root . --verify GAP_ANALYSIS.md
```

This will:
- ✅ Verify claimed requirements are TESTED or BENCHED
- ❌ Fail with exit code 2 if claims are overclaimed
